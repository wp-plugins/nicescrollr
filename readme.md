== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't it work with my theme? =

Most likely, this is because your theme already has the Nicescroll library on board. If that's the case, I advise you to uninstall this plugin again to prevent compatibility issues. Of course, you can always ask your theme developer to implement a function to disable the built-in solution if you like to use this plugin and its options.

The capability required for being able to customize settings is the following:

* `nicescrollr_edit` - The user can change settings regarding this plugin.

= Can you help me? =

Unfortunately, I cannot provide free support for this plugin. I honestly wish I could. However, very soon you will find a link for further informations.
