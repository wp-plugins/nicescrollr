== Description ==

This plugin brings the "Nicescroll" scrollbar to your website. You can use it on both the frontend and the backend. It is fully customizable, so you can tweak and tune every single parameter Nicescroll has to offer! You can style it totally different for both views. You can even keep the default scrollbar if you like. It's all up to you. Install and enjoy :-)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't it work with my theme? =

Most likely, this is because your theme (or another plugin?) already has the Nicescroll library on board. If that's the case, I advise you to uninstall this plugin again to prevent compatibility issues. Of course, you can always ask your theme developer to implement a function to disable the built-in solution if you like to use this plugin and its options.

The capability required for being able to customize settings is the following:

* `nicescrollr_edit` - The user can change settings regarding this plugin.

= Can you help me? =

Well, I provide some basic support on this plugins support page. I check that place up to three times a week, so you may have to be a bit patient ;-)
