== Description ==

A plugin to add Nicescroll functionality to the frontend and the backend.

### Features ###

It is highly customizable trough an extensive options panel, giving you full control over (almost) every native Nicescroll option.

### Requirements ###

Nothing that's not already built-in in WordPress.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `nicescrollr` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the "Nicescrollr" plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3. Edit a post to add a custom background.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

### Why doesn't it work with my theme? ###

Most likely, this is because your theme already has the Nicescroll library on board. If that's the case, I advise you to uninstall this plugin again to prevent compatibility issues. Of course, you can always ask your theme developer to implement a function to disable the built-in solution if you like to use this plugin and its settings.

The capability required for being able to customize settings is the following:

* `nicescrollr_edit` - The user can change settings regarding this plugin.

### Can you help me? ###

Unfortunately, I cannot provide free support for this plugin. I honestly wish I could. However, very soon you will find a link for further informations.
