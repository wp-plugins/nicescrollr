### Requirements ###

Nothing that's not already built-in into WordPress.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `nicescrollr` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the "Nicescrollr" plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3. You will find its settings page listed in the "settings" section.
3. Go to the plugin settings page and fit it to your needs :-) Have fun!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

### Why doesn't it work with my theme? ###

Most likely, this is because your theme already has the Nicescroll library on board. If that's the case, I advise you to uninstall this plugin again to prevent compatibility issues. Of course, you can always ask your theme developer to implement a function to disable the built-in solution if you like to use this plugin and its options.

The capability required for being able to customize settings is the following:

* `nicescrollr_edit` - The user can change settings regarding this plugin.

### Can you help me? ###

Unfortunately, I cannot provide free support for this plugin. I honestly wish I could. However, very soon you will find a link for further informations.
